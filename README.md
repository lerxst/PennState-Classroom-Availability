# Penn State Classroom Availability
This project is aimed to provide Penn State students (currently those in IST) with information about classrooms such as their availability and features.

## To Do
- Show open rooms at the current time
- Display a table of building availability
- Obtain course information based on event (course description, professor, etc.)
- Add classroom information such as pictures, number of computers, type of computers, and installed applications
- Add a map of the building
- Add 'open until' for rooms that are available for less than 30 minutes
- Possibly expand to other buildings on campus

## Thanks
Special thanks to Dan Servich for pitching this idea to me and to @mfriedenberg for his valuable input
